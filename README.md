# PIGMENT
Predictive Interdisciplinary Glaze Modeling and Experimentation (PIGMENT): Predicting glaze color is notoriously difficult - potters still rely heavily on test tiles and experience. The chemical and physical processes are understood but the size and complexity of all the interacting variables make this problem a good target for applied mathematics.
